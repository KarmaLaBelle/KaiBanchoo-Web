## KaiBanchoo!web

A framework I am creating for fun and educational purposes, thus the reason I picked the license. (IMO play osu! on the real servers as it was intended.)

#Short Form

- Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
- NonCommercial — You may not use the material for commercial purposes.
- ShareAlike — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.

## Credit/Other things

- Osu! is a game developed by Dean "peppy" Herbert, and like all good things, he owns the title, and code.

- KaiBanchoo is based off of the work of Dillon "Itsyuka" Modine-Thuen and Castar's packet findings.

- If you like osu!, play on the real server and maybe drop some cash on there too, believe in the peppy, and the peppy will believe in you, unless you're Cookiezi.
